Assignment 1 (Visual Studio Code: Command Line and Version Control) for MMC6278

1. I ran into an issue concerning the screenshot. I initially took the screenshot and did not see the updated changes, so I pulled and then took the screenshot. I am unclear if pulling was intentionally not in the instructions initially, but I want to express that my visual studio code did not have the other branch changes prior to pulling.
2. The background is a resource found on Pixabay.com (https://pixabay.com/illustrations/background-watermelon-pattern-fruit-5580056/). No other resources were used.
